# Broadcaster

Report corruption and other incidents that need government intervention.

> A full-stack web application built for presentation at the Andela Bootcamp (Kigali Fellowship Cycle 13).

### Project Description

Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localized solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of Broadcaster. Broadcaster enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that need government intervention.
