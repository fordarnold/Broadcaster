        	<h3>Report corruption and other incidents that require government intervention</h3>

        	<p>
        		Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localized solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of Broadcaster. Broadcaster enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that need government intervention
